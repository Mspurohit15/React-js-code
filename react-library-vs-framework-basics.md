# React is a Library

React is often referred to as a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces. The key reason it's called a library and not a framework is that React is focused on one main thing: creating the **view layer** in web applications. Unlike frameworks, React doesn’t provide built-in solutions for other aspects like routing or state management. You can pick and choose what tools or libraries to use alongside React.

## Framework vs Library

It's important to understand the difference between a **framework** and a **library** when learning React. Here’s a simple comparison:

### 1. **Library**:
- A library is like a **toolbox**. You choose when and how to use its tools.
- React is a library because it handles only the view part of the application. You have the flexibility to integrate it with other tools for things like routing, state management, etc.
- You have more control over the structure of your application. React doesn’t impose strict rules on how you should organize your code.

### 2. **Framework**:
- A framework is more like a **skeleton** for your application. It provides a full structure and guides you on how to build the entire app, from views to data handling to routing.
- Frameworks like Angular or Vue come with built-in features such as routing, state management, and more, offering a complete solution.
- In a framework, you follow the framework’s way of doing things. It controls the flow of your application.

### Key Difference:
- **Library**: You call the library to do specific tasks (you are in control).
- **Framework**: The framework calls your code and provides a structured way to build the app (the framework is in control).

### Simple Example 1: Library vs Framework

Let’s use a real-world example to make this clearer:

- **Library Example (React)**:  
  Imagine you’re building a house, and React is like your **electrician**. You call the electrician only when you need electrical work done. You are still in charge of hiring a plumber, a painter, etc., and managing the whole house-building process. **You control when and how to use the electrician** (library).

- **Framework Example (Angular)**:  
  In contrast, a framework is like hiring a **general contractor** to build your house. The contractor will bring their own team (electrician, plumber, painter) and tell you how the house will be built. The framework handles all aspects of the house-building process, and **you follow the framework’s plan**.

### Simple Example 2 : Restaurant (Library vs Framework)

Imagine you're opening a restaurant. Here’s how a library and a framework would look in this context:

- **Library Example (React)**:  
  Using React is like **hiring a chef** for your restaurant. You tell the chef when to cook and what to cook. However, you are still responsible for everything else — buying ingredients, managing the wait staff, setting the menu, and running the restaurant. **You are in control** and only call the chef (library) when you need meals prepared.

- **Framework Example (Angular)**:  
  Using a framework is like hiring a **full catering service**. The catering team takes care of everything from cooking, managing the staff, setting the tables, and even deciding on the menu. You follow their structure, and they run the entire operation. **The catering team (framework) is in control** of how things run.

In short:
- With **React (library)**, you have the freedom to handle other parts of your project (or restaurant), choosing and integrating tools as needed.
- With a **framework (like Angular)**, you get a complete, pre-structured system that guides you through the entire process, but you follow its predefined setup.
