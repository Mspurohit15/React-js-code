# Run and Build React Projects

After creating a React project, you need to know how to run it for development and build it for production. 
This guide covers the process for both **Create React App** and **Vite** projects.

# Create React App Project Structure: 

When you create a React app using **Create React App**, the project comes with a predefined structure. Here's an explanation of its key components:

---

## Project Structure Overview :

my-app/ ├── node_modules/ ├── public/ │ ├── index.html │ ├── favicon.ico │ └── other-assets ├── src/ │ ├── App.css │ ├── App.js │ ├── App.test.js │ ├── index.css │ ├── index.js │ ├── logo.svg │ └── reportWebVitals.js ├── .gitignore ├── package.json ├── README.md └── yarn.lock or package-lock.json

---

## Key Folders and Files

### **1. `node_modules/`**
- This folder contains all the dependencies installed via npm.
- You typically don't interact directly with this folder.

### **2. `public/`**
- Holds static files like `index.html` and images.
- The `index.html` file is the single entry point for your app. React injects components here dynamically.

### **3. `src/`**
This folder contains your app's main code. Key files include:
- **`index.js`**: The entry point for React. It renders the root component into the DOM.
- **`App.js`**: The main component of your app, often used as a starting point for other components.
- **`App.css`**: Contains default styles for the `App.js` component.
- **`App.test.js`**: A testing file for the `App.js` component.
- **`index.css`**: Global styles for your app.
- **`reportWebVitals.js`**: Used to measure app performance.

### **4. Other Files**
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and folders to ignore in version control.
- **`package.json`**: Contains app metadata, scripts, and a list of dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: Provides information about the app and its usage.

---

## Notes
- You can customize this structure as your project grows.
- Use the `src/` folder for creating reusable components, managing state, and organizing files.

## What's Different Between Create React App and Vite?

| Feature                      | Create React App (CRA)       | Vite                     |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Dev Server Speed**         | Slower                      | Much faster              |
| **Build Time**               | Moderate                    | Faster                   |
| **Configuration**            | Limited (eject required)    | Highly customizable      |
| **Default Structure**        | Slightly larger             | Minimal and flexible     |
| **Development Focus**        | Suitable for simple projects| Optimized for modern apps|

# Vite Project Structure

When you create a React app using **Vite**, the project structure is lightweight and optimized for performance. Here's an explanation of its key components:

---

## Project Structure Overview

vite-project/ ├── node_modules/ ├── public/ ├── src/ │ ├── App.css │ ├── App.jsx │ ├── main.jsx │ └── other-components/ ├── .gitignore ├── index.html ├── package.json ├── vite.config.js └── README.md



---

## Key Folders and Files

### **1. `node_modules/`**
- Similar to CRA, this folder contains all project dependencies installed via npm.

### **2. `public/`**
- Static assets that don’t need processing by Vite.
- Directly accessible via the root URL.

### **3. `src/`**
This folder is where you write your app's main code:
- **`main.jsx`**: The entry point for the app. It sets up the React root component.
- **`App.jsx`**: The main component of your app, similar to CRA's `App.js`.
- **`App.css`**: Contains styles specific to the `App.jsx` component.
- **`other-components/`**: (Optional) A folder to organize additional components.

### **4. Other Files**
- **`.gitignore`**: Similar to CRA, it defines files and folders to exclude from version control.
- **`index.html`**: The entry point of the app, served directly by Vite. You can include metadata and links to assets here.
- **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Configuration file for Vite. You can customize options like server settings, plugins, and build behavior.
- **`README.md`**: A place to document project details.

---

## Notes
- Vite's structure is simpler compared to CRA, making it easier to modify.
- The `vite.config.js` file allows more flexibility for advanced setups.

## **Default Scripts**

### **Create React App Scripts**

When you create a project with CRA, these scripts are included in the `package.json`:

| Script             | Command            | Description                                              |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Start**          | `npm start`        | Starts the app in development mode on a local server.    |
| **Build**          | `npm run build`    | Builds the app for production in the `build/` folder.    |
| **Test**           | `npm test`         | Runs tests in interactive watch mode.                   |
| **Eject**          | `npm run eject`    | Ejects the CRA configuration for customization.          |

---

### **Vite Scripts**

Vite projects come with lightweight scripts in the `package.json`:

| Script             | Command            | Description                                              |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dev**            | `npm run dev`      | Starts a development server with hot module replacement. |
| **Build**          | `npm run build`    | Builds the app for production in the `dist/` folder.     |
| **Preview**        | `npm run preview`  | Previews the production build locally.                  |

## What's Different Between Vite and Create React App?

| Feature                      | Vite                      | Create React App (CRA)  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Setup Time**               | Quick and lightweight     | Moderate                |
| **Build Output**             | `dist` folder             | `build` folder          |
| **Flexibility**              | Highly flexible           | Limited without ejecting|
| **Development Speed**        | Optimized for speed       | Slower                  |



## **Differences in Project Structure and Scripts**

| Aspect                     | Create React App (CRA)                   | Vite                              |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Static Files**           | Managed in the `public/` folder          | Can be in `public/` or directly. |
| **Entry File**             | `src/index.js`                           | `src/main.jsx`                   |
| **Configuration**          | Hidden; requires `eject` to customize    | Easy customization with `vite.config.js`. |
| **Development Command**    | `npm start`                              | `npm run dev`                    |
| **Production Preview**     | Not available by default                 | `npm run preview`                |
| **Performance**            | Slower builds and hot reloading          | Faster builds and instant reload. |
