## Custom React App: Learning React Under the Hood

This project is designed to help you understand how React works behind the scenes by building and experimenting 
with custom rendering functions. 

It starts with a minimal implementation of a `customRender` function to mimic React's rendering logic and evolves into using React's official libraries for a deeper understanding of its API.
