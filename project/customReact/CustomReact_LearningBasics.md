## Custom React App: Learning React Under the Hood

This project is designed to help you understand how React works behind the scenes by building and experimenting 
with custom rendering functions. 

It starts with a minimal implementation of a `custom render` function to mimic React's rendering logic and evolves
into using React's official libraries for a deeper understanding of its API.

## Introduction

This repository focuses on building a deeper understanding of React by:
- Implementing custom rendering logic without React.
- Exploring how React internally uses objects like `reactElement` and how it maps them to the DOM.
- Gradually transitioning to official React code using `JSX` and `createRoot`.

This is ideal for beginners and curious developers who want to understand the "magic" behind React.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **`index.html`**: The entry point for your application. This contains a `<div>` with an ID of `root` where the app will render.
2. **`customreact.js`**: Implements the custom rendering function to map a React-like object to the DOM.
3. **Second Example**: Builds on the concepts learned in `customreact.js` using Reactâ€™s official APIs.

## Custom Rendering (Manual Implementation)

In `customreact.js`, we manually implement a rendering function `customRender` to convert a React-like object into DOM elements.


### Code Explanation

```javascript
function customRender(reactElement, container) {
    const domElement = document.createElement(reactElement.type);
    domElement.innerHTML = reactElement.children;

    for (const props in reactElement.props) {
        if (props === 'children') continue;
        domElement.setAttribute(props, reactElement.props[props]);
    }

    container.appendChild(domElement);
}

const reactElement = {
    type: 'a',
    props: {
        href: 'https://google.com',
        target: '_blank'
    },
    children: 'click me to visit google'
};

const mainContainer = document.querySelector('#root');
customRender(reactElement, mainContainer);
